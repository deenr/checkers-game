# Java Checkers Game
This repository contains the code for a simple checkers game application that was written in Java and JavaFX using NetBeans. The project was a university assignment and was created by Sven Kumpen, Yannick Claes, and myself. This was my first experience with coding and it was the project that eventually got me into coding.

### Description
The Java Checkers Game is a two-player game where each player controls their own set of pieces on a checkerboard. The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or to block them from making any moves. The game features a graphical user interface that allows users to interact with the game board and move their pieces.

In addition to the standard game rules, the Java Checkers Game includes a special move called the kamikaze move. This move allows players to sacrifice one of their own pieces to destroy all of the opponent's pieces within one square of the sacrificed piece. This move adds an extra level of strategy to the game and makes it more challenging and exciting.

### Technologies Used
The Java Checkers Game was developed using the following technologies:

- Java programming language
- JavaFX for the graphical user interface
- NetBeans as the integrated development environment (IDE)

### Installation and Usage
To run the Java Checkers Game application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in NetBeans.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Use the graphical user interface to play the game.

Once the game is running, you can use the kamikaze move to strategically take out your opponent's pieces and gain an advantage on the board.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Sven Kumpen and Yannick Claes for working on this project with me and for introducing me to the world of coding through this project.
